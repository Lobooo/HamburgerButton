# HamburgerButton
A HamburgerButton like Android by SwiftUI and UIKit

UIKit version is based on @fastred https://github.com/fastred/HamburgerButton, There is a problem, when button appeared, it is on the state of Arrow not Hamburger, I don't know how to fix it yet.

SwiftUI version is code with pure SwiftUI, and it also has a problem, I didn't find a way to use 2 sets timingCurve of animations in rotation() and offset modifier(), but I had modify the UIBezierPath to reduce animation artifacts

If you can solve the above problems, welcome to let me know
