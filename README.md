# HamburgerButton Version
* HamburgerButton_SwiftUI: code with pure SwiftUI, it has a small problem, I didn't find a way to use 2 sets timingCurve of animations in rotation() and offset modifier(), but I had modified the UIBezierPath to reduce animation artifacts

* HamburgerButton_UIKit: based on UIKit @fastred(https://github.com/fastred/HamburgerButton), and packaged to SwiftUI View, There is a serious problem, when the button appeared, it is on the state of Arrow not Hamburger, I don't know how to fix it yet.

If you can solve the above problems, welcome to let me know
